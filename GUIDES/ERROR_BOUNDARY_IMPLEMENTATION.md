# Error Boundary Implementation Summary

## Purpose of ErrorBoundary

The ErrorBoundary component was created to provide consistent error handling across all React contexts in the application. This ensures that if any context fails to initialize or encounters an error during runtime, the application degrades gracefully instead of crashing completely.

## Why It's Needed

1. **Context Initialization Failures**: Database connections, network issues, or data validation errors during context setup
2. **Runtime Errors**: Unexpected errors in reducers, middleware, or hooks
3. **User Experience**: Provides fallback UI instead of blank/broken screens
4. **Debugging**: Centralizes error logging and reporting
5. **Resilience**: Allows parts of the app to continue working even if one context fails

## Applied Consistently to All Contexts

### âœ… All Context Providers Now Have Error Boundaries:

1. **ApplicantContext** (`/app/contexts/ApplicantContext.tsx`)

   - Wrapped with error boundary
   - Fallback: "Failed to load Applicant context. Please refresh the page."

2. **OrderContext** (`/app/contexts/order/OrderContext.tsx`)

   - Wrapped with error boundary
   - Fallback: "Failed to load Order context. Please refresh the page."

3. **MultistepContext** (`/app/contexts/multistep/MultistepContext.tsx`)

   - Wrapped with error boundary
   - Fallback: "Failed to load Multistep context. Please refresh the page."

4. **GiftContext** (`/app/contexts/gift/GiftContext.tsx`)
   - Wrapped with error boundary
   - Fallback: "Failed to load Gift context. Please refresh the page."

## Implementation Pattern

Each context follows the same consistent pattern:

```tsx
// Before: Direct export
export const SomeProvider: React.FC<Props> = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  // provider logic
  return <BaseProvider>{children}</BaseProvider>;
};

// After: Wrapped with error boundary
const SomeProviderComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  // provider logic
  return <BaseProvider>{children}</BaseProvider>;
};

export const SomeProvider = withErrorBoundary(
  SomeProviderComponent,
  "SomeContext",
  <div>Failed to load Some context. Please refresh the page.</div>
);
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All contexts now have identical error handling
2. **Reliability**: App won't crash if one context fails
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages with recovery options
4. **Debugging**: Centralized error logging for easier troubleshooting
5. **Maintainability**: Standard pattern for all future contexts

## Integration with Existing Architecture

- **Preserves Functional Patterns**: Works with existing Result/Maybe types
- **Middleware Compatible**: Error boundaries work alongside existing middleware
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support maintained
- **Performance**: No impact on normal operation, only activates on errors

The ErrorBoundary implementation ensures fair and consistent treatment of all contexts while maintaining the sophisticated functional programming architecture already in place.
